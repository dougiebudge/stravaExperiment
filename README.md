This repo is for me to experiment with the Strava API.
Before I put it on Github publicly. It has to...

Meet a minimum standard of web dev practice:
- Pull data using a class + creds

Graphs have to tell a story:
- Show me fitness and performance over time and show me a link between those and training load + fatigue

Quantify impact:
- Quantify how much training load impacts average performance
- Quantify how much fatigue impacts one-off performance
- Quantify how much the difficulty of courses impacts one-off performance
